# BGP Automation with Cisco Packet Tracer and PyCharm

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the automation of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configuration and validation using Cisco Packet Tracer for network simulation and PyCharm for testing and validation.

## Technologies Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: Network simulation software used to configure and visualize BGP.
- **Python**: For automating the validation of BGP configuration and performing tests.
- **PyCharm**: IDE used for writing and running Python scripts to validate the BGP configurations.

## Steps Taken

### 1. BGP Configuration in Cisco Packet Tracer

- Configured BGP on Cisco routers using appropriate commands.
- Set up BGP attributes like ASN (Autonomous System Number), network statements, and other relevant settings to establish BGP peering and routing.

### 2. Automated Validation Using Python and PyCharm

- Wrote Python scripts to interact with the Cisco routers, using automation tools such as `SSH`.
- Validated BGP configurations by checking the status of BGP sessions, routes, and other relevant BGP attributes.
- Used PyCharm for debugging, testing, and executing the Python scripts.

## Requirements

- Cisco Packet Tracer (for simulating the network).
- Python (for running the validation scripts).
- PyCharm (for script development and debugging).
